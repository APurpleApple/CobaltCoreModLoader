# CobaltCoreModLoader
A simple mod loader for the game cobalt core by rocket rat games.

# CobaltCoreModLoader
This is the actual executable that handles loading Cobalt Core, patching it, loading mods and allow them to do their patchwork, before booting the game.

# CobaltCoreModding.Definitions
This lib contains useful classes that allow a mod to communicate with the loader for some functionality like adding sprites without conflict with other mods.

# DemoMod
A simple playground for a mod. it needs to have its reference to the cobalt core dll packaged within the executable manully resolved as the dll is propriatory.

# Credits
Much thanks to the people at rocket rat games for allowing me to create this piece of software.
